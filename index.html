                <h3>This movement is characterized by organic, flowing lines and natural forms, emphasizing artistry and
                    craftsmanship.</h3>
                <p>It emerged as a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism, and historicism of the 19th
                    century. It began around 1890 and reached its peak at the turn of the 20th century. The movement was
                    inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.</p>

        <h3>Art Nouveau paved the way for later modernist movements, influencing Art Deco and modern architecture. </h3>
        <div class="subCol">
            <h4>The movement was part of a broader cultural shift towards modernism and away from the rigid structures
                of 19th-century society. It reflected contemporary interests in psychology, symbolism, and a more
                holistic view of nature.</h4>
            <p>Art Nouveau had a wide-reaching impact, with variations seen in different countries, adapting to local
                cultural contexts. It contributed to the global conversation on the role and purpose of art and design
                in modern society. Art Nouveau was more than just an artistic style; it represented a philosophical
                approach to art and design, seeking to harmonize the artistic with the functional and to bring beauty
                into everyday life. Its legacy is seen in its influence on later artistic movements and its enduring
                appeal in various forms of contemporary design.</p>

            <h5>IMPACT ON THE WORLD</h5>
            <h2>Design and Architecture</h2>
            <h4>Art Nouveau had a profound influence on Design and Architecture. It was one of the first styles to
                emphasize the integration of art into everyday life, influencing the
                design of everyday objects.</h4>
            <p>Art Nouveau had a profound impact on architecture and interior design, leading to the creation of
                buildings
                and spaces with distinctive curved lines and organic forms. It
                challenged traditional artistic norms, encouraging future generations of artists and designers to
                experiment
                and innovate. Art Nouveau had a wide-reaching impact, with variations seen in different countries,
                adapting to local cultural contexts. Artists like Gustav Klimt, Alphonse Mucha,
                and
                Aubrey Beardsley. Architects like Victor Horta, Antoni Gaud√≠, and Henry van de Velde. Many Art Nouveau
                buildings and artworks are now considered cultural treasures and are preserved as part of the world
                heritage. </p>
